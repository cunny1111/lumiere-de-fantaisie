# Lumière de Fantaisie

**Lumière de Fantaisie** is a modern, open-source (gacha) game launcher for Windows.  
It supports multiple (gacha) games. Auto-updates, and built-in mod loading will be implemented soon.
- **For now please start in Administator mode or else it has no permission to run the game.**

# Current issues

- Only support Wuthering Waves and Honkai: Star Rail for now.
- It has kinda trash code, but I will try to clean them up in the future.
