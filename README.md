# Lumière de Fantaisie

**Lumière de Fantaisie** is a modern, open-source (gacha) game launcher for Windows.  
It supports multiple (gacha) games. Auto-updates, and built-in mod loading will be implemented soon.

# Current issues

Only support Wuthering Waves and Honkai: Star Rail for noww.
It has kinda trash code, but I will try to clean them up in the future.
